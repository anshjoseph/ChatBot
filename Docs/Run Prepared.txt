 Whenever you go for a run—on a track or trail or during a race—make sure you've packed these key staples:

    A watch or GPS tracker to log your total time
    A music player
    A cell phone, if you don't mind holding onto it
    A RoadID (a bracelet that includes all your vital info)

If it's a sunny day, wear sunglasses. "They reduce glare, which can decrease squinting, ultimately releasing the tension in your shoulders," said Kastor. And that's a performance bonus because relaxing them helps conserve energy on your runs.
