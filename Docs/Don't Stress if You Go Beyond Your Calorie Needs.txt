 A healthy eating plan has a few characteristics. One of those characteristics is staying within your daily calorie needs when it comes to what you eat and drink.15 (Of note, everyone's daily caloric needs will be different.)

If you have a day when you consume more calories than your body needs to function, try not to stress. Keep in mind that it takes a lot of calories to gain a pound of body fat. "So really, that one off day doesn't usually result in any significant weight gain," said Newgent.

What you do the next day and the day after is really important. Also, remember that starvation and excessive exercise are not healthy answers for an off day.

If you get off track, you can set up a personal reminder (e.g., on a sticky note or mobile device) to ensure you eat more mindfully on future days. You can also consider doing some meal planning for home or when you're on the go and aim to maintain a healthy exercise schedule.
