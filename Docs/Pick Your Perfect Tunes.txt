 Running with music is a great way to get in a good workout groove. To pick the ultimate playlist, think about what gets you going and that you find uplifting.

"I know several elite athletes that listen to what we'd consider 'relaxing' music, such as symphony music, while they do a hard workout," said Kastor.

The best part about music during a workout is that the right music can make you feel better emotionally, help you perform better, and improve how much oxygen you take in.
