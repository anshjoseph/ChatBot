 Foods like fruits, vegetables, and lean meats can go a long way for your fitness journey.

There are even some delicious, healthy snack options to take advantage of, like hummus, grapes and walnuts, and apple slices with cheese.

Additionally, some key ingredients may make it a lot easier to meet your weight-loss goals. During your next grocery store run, you could also consider placing Newgent's top three diet-friendly items in your cart:

    Balsamic vinegar (it adds a pop of low-cal flavor to veggies and salads)
    In-shell nuts (their protein and fiber keep you satiated)
    Fat-free plain yogurt (a creamy, comforting source of protein)

"Plus, Greek yogurt also works wonders as a natural low-calorie base for dressings and dipsâ€”or as a tangier alternative to sour cream," said Newgent.
