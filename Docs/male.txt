personalized meal plan for a male with a height of 180 cm, weight of 80 kg, and age of 35 years aiming for a 1,500-calorie diet to support weight loss.

    Calculate TDEE:
    Male: Calories per day = 10x(weight in kg) + 6.25x(height in cm) â€“ 5x(age) + 5
    TDEE = 10(80) + 6.25(180) - 5(35) + 5
    TDEE = 800 + 1125 - 175 + 5
    TDEE = 1755 calories per day
