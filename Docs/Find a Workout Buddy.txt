 A friend you can work out with is very helpful for staying motivated, but it's important to find someone who will inspireâ€”not discourage. So make a list of all your exercise-loving friends, then see who fits this criterion, Andrew Kastor, an ASICS running coach, told Health:

    Can your pal meet to exercise on a regular basis?
    Are they supportive (not disparaging) of your goals?
    Will your bud be able to keep up with you or even push your limits in key workouts?

If you've got someone that fits all three, make the phone call to start getting fitness plans together. But if you don't have someone close to you who could be your workout buddy, you may be able to find other ways to exercise with others.

You could check out a local gym or recreation center for more information about group workout classes, personal training sessions, or exercise-focused groups. You could even ask your family members or friends if they know individuals who are also looking for a workout buddy.
