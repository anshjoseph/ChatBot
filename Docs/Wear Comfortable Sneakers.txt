 You shouldn't buy shoes that hurt: "Your shoes should feel comfortable from the first step," said Kastor.

Your feet swell during the day and stop in the late afternoon, so if you need sneakers, you'll want to shop when your feet are biggest. Also, make sure the shoes are a little roomyâ€”enough to wiggle your toes, but no more than that.

They should be comfy from the get-go, but they'll be even more so once you've walked or ran 20 to 40 miles in them, said Kastor.
