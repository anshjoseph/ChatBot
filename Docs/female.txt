personalized meal plan for a female with a height of 160 cm, weight of 60 kg, and age of 30 years aiming for a 1,500-calorie diet to support weight loss.

    Calculate TDEE:
    Female: Calories per day = 10x(weight in kg) + 6.25x(height in cm) – 5x(age) – 161
    TDEE = 10(60) + 6.25(160) - 5(30) - 161
    TDEE = 600 + 1000 - 150 - 161
    TDEE = 1289 calories per day
