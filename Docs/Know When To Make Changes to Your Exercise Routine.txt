 If your weight on the scale plateaus or your muscles don't feel as fatigued, it might be time to increase the intensity of your exercise.

Take if you decide to change your running routine: "The general rule of thumb is to up the amount of miles run, for races half-marathon length and longer, by 5 to 10% each week," said Kastor.

You might also want to switch up your routine if you've been doing the same thing repeatedly, such as using the elliptical, cycling, or exercising with a workout DVD. While these are all great ways to work out, it's best to add some variety.

You could also do a different type of exercise (e.g., HIIT, cardio, Pilates) every time you work out or dedicate specific days or times for different exercises. That way, you can have more variety throughout your week.
