 After a grueling workout, there's a good chance you're going to be feeling sore thighs and tight calves.

Fortunately, you might get relief from post-fitness aches by using cold water immersion in the form of ice baths. This involves submerging your lower body in a cold bath (50 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit; you may have to throw in some ice cubes to get it cold enough) for 10 to 15 minutes.34

"Many top athletes use this trick to help reduce soreness after training sessions," said Kastor. "An athlete training for an important race should consider getting one to two massages per month to help aid in training recovery."

Of note, when a person puts their body in cold water, doing so can lead to increased breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. The body can also lose heat faster in cold water than in air.5

In other words, cold water can cause the body to work harder, which may not be good for certain health conditions. People should not use ice baths if they have, for example, the following conditions:

    Cryoglobulinemia (a condition where antibodies in the blood thicken in the cold)6
    Heart conditions
    Impaired circulation
    Open wounds
    Raynaud's disease (a condition where blood vessels get narrow due to cold or stress)7
    Type 1 and type 2 diabetes

Cold temperatures might also worsen dysesthesia symptoms (when normal stimuli, like touch, are painful or don't feel good)8 or lead to urticaria, or hives.9

To be sure ice baths are safe for you, talk with a healthcare provider if you are interested in trying this type of therapy.
