 While we've all heard that running shoes break down after logging lots of miles (about 300 to 350), you may still be holding on to your favorite pair. But that's not a good idea.

"Glue has a tendency to break down under ultraviolet light, as do the other materials that make up the shoe," said Kastor. So even if your sneakers have only 150 miles on them but are more than two years old, recycle them because chances are they've already started deteriorating.
