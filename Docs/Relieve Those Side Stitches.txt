 You know the feeling: a sharp pain just below the rib cage that always seems to pop up when you're working out your hardest. It's called the side stitch, also medically known as exercise-related transient abdominal pain (ETAP).17

Side stitches can be a major nuisance—especially when they keep you from completing a workout. Suggested ways to ease the ache have included actions such as:17

    Deep breathing
    Pushing on the area that hurts
    Stopping exercise

However, out of those methods, stopping a workout is the most helpful way to get relief from side stitches.17

You might also be able to prevent side stitches from happening in the first place. Waiting at least two to four hours to do any physical activity after consuming a lot of foods or drinks can help. You might also consider limiting how much you move your torso—or at least have support (e.g., a wide belt) for any torso movement.17
